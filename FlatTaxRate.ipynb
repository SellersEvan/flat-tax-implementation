    "# Implementing Flat Tax Rate\n",
    "We will be looking at what individuals actually pay in income tax, and what they are expected to pay (before returns and credtis). We will then being using this data to generate the best flat tax rate system. The flat tax rate system will remove all returns and credits from income tax and be a flat rate on your income, but our goals is to ensure that no-one pays more than they are currently paying (expecially low income families). Because of the complications in 2020 and the COVID-19 virus the US goverment provided many tax credits to assist with the burden of the market changes. This in-turn means the tax revenue varies slightly so we will be using 2019 tax records to create an ideal flat tax system, instead of the outlier low revenue of 2020. \\\n",
